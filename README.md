# Browser-Isolation
This will be able to auto launch a browser in sandbox mode if you use Windows 11 or Windows 10 Professional and higher
This script creates two shortcuts on the desktop: one to launch the Windows Sandbox and another to launch the web browser. Then, it modifies the shortcut for the web browser to launch the Windows Sandbox first, and then launch the web browser inside the sandbox.
To use the script, you will need to replace the following value with the correct path to the web browser executable file on your system:
â€¢	"C:\path\to\browser.exe": This is the path to the web browser executable file.
After running the script, you can use the "Browser" shortcut on the desktop to launch the web browser inside the Windows Sandbox. Every time you open the web browser, the Windows Sandbox will be launched automatically and the web browser will be opened inside the sandbox.
